# ADI's Mission & Vision

If you’re reading this, you’re likely familiar with the profound impact blockchain technology has made on the global financial industry over the past decade - as well as blockchain’s immense potential to serve as the rails for the future of finance.&#x20;

But even the blockchain industry’s most ardent proponents (including ADI Foundation) can acknowledge that the blockchain revolution is not yet truly global in scope. Most blockchain activity - and the corresponding benefits it can provide governments, businesses and citizens - is still concentrated in relatively few geographic markets.&#x20;

While ADI Chain was developed to co-write the next chapter of financial history, much of the world has missed out on the last couple. Today, approximately one quarter of the world’s population remains unbanked and billions more are completely disconnected from the digital transformations that developed markets have experienced since the advent of the internet.&#x20;

The ADI Foundation’s goal is to play a major role in leveling this playing field by bringing one billion people onchain in emerging markets by 2030 with the launch of ADI Chain.&#x20;

ADI Chain is a modular, highly performant, customizable, and cost‑effective Layer‑2 (L2) blockchain secured by Ethereum. Built on zkSync’s open, modular stack, ADI Chain executes transactions off‑chain, provides verification via zero‑knowledge validity proofs, and finalizes on Ethereum, combining high throughput with L1-grade security.&#x20;

ADI Chain is EVM-compatible, allowing developers to deploy Ethereum smart contracts and dApps with minimal modifications, while benefiting from dramatically lower fees and faster finality.&#x20;

ADI Chain is designed to empower institutions and governments to leverage blockchain-enabled innovations — spanning stablecoins, cross-border remittances, decentralized financial networks, tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), digital payments, healthcare data, and logistics — to unlock new forms of trust, efficiency, and inclusion that benefit citizens and societies&#x20;

And, unlike the vast majority of market entrants, ADI Chain is built to provide L3 chains with built-in compliance capabilities to ensure networks can be fully compliant with the laws and regulations governing their operations.

### Governments and institutions need Different Ideas&#x20;

#### Meet the digital upgrade for legacy systems&#x20;

Legacy infrastructure - from government services to banking to digital identity - remains fragmented and opaque. This is especially true across many parts of the Middle East, Africa and Asia - regions that account for approximately 75% of the world’s people.&#x20;

Services don’t connect. Personal data isn’t secure. Using money can be as difficult as earning it.&#x20;

While solving challenges of this scale and complexity will require contributions from all levels of society, government and institutions will play a key role - just like they did paving the road to growth for today’s developed economies a century ago.&#x20;

Yet, governments and institutions have generally shied away from blockchain technology because current systems lack the compliance features needed to govern their nations. ADI Chain was designed specifically to bridge those gaps.&#x20;

#### Delivering compliant innovation across the globe&#x20;

ADI Chain marries innovation and compliance with its capability to build modular Layer‑3s (L3) on top of the network. Entities can operate their own compliance-optimized L3 domain, segmented by jurisdiction, sector, or policy, while staying securely connected to the ADI Chain L2. Every project built on ADI Chain will receive the benefits of a transparent, trackable blockchain, economic security from the Ethereum L1 and the flexible compliance features required for its particular use case and jurisdiction.&#x20;

The long-term vision is an **interconnected system of institutional and government L3s**, that are connected through the ADI chain to the broader Web3 ecosystem. This should see trillions of dollars move onchain and flow both cross-business and cross-border, in a transparent, trackable and secure way, with same day settlement.&#x20;

Efficient. Connected. Fully compliant.&#x20;
