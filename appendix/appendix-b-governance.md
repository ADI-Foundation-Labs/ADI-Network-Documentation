# Appendix B - Governance

At launch, no tokenholder governance is active for the ADI Chain. While the Charter establishes a comprehensive governance framework, this framework remains dormant until formally activated by an Activation Resolution. Activation will occur following the deployment and audit of the relevant governance smart contracts, publication of detailed Governance Specifications, and the filing of updated documents with the ADGM Registrar within the required regulatory window.
