# ADI Chain Infrastructure & Ecosystem Features

While $ADI powers the network, the broader ADI Chain infrastructure introduces features that enhance utility and adoption:

#### 1. Stablecoin Rail

ADI Chain will serve as the infrastructure for a regulated Dirham-backed stablecoin, developed in collaboration with IHC, First Abu Dhabi Bank, and ADQ. All stablecoin transactions require $ADI for gas, reinforcing its utility and demand.

#### 2. EVM Compatibility & Interoperability

ADI Chain supports ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards, enabling seamless bridging and composability across Ethereum and other L2/L3 networks.

#### 3. Enterprise & Government L3 Enablement

ADI Chain is designed to support scalable, compliant L3s for use cases such as:

1. Digital identity
2. Registries
3. Healthcare
4. Payments
5. Logistics

These domains benefit from the security and performance of ADI Chain while leveraging $ADI for gas and settlement.
