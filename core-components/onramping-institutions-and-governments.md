# Onramping Institutions and Governments

ADI Chain provides the infrastructure for institutions to onboard their users and clients and interconnect services across sectors, such as payments, identity, registries, healthcare, energy, and logistics. By using blockchain as a neutral settlement and data layer, institutions can link existing systems, expand across borders, and enforce policy‑compliant operations via L3 networks.
